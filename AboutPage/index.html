      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Centsible was born from a simple yet frustrating realization – despite
        having access to countless budgeting apps and financial tools, we found
        ourselves constantly asking "Where did all my money go?" at the end of
        each month. Traditional expense trackers felt either too complicated for
        daily use or too simplistic to provide meaningful insights. We wanted
        something that made financial tracking as natural as checking your
        phone, without overwhelming users with complex features they'd never
        use. The name "Centsible" perfectly captured our philosophy: making
        sense of every cent while keeping the experience sensible and
        straightforward.<br />What started as a personal project to solve our
        own financial awareness challenges quickly evolved into something much
        bigger. We realized that financial literacy isn't just about knowing
        complex investment strategies – it begins with understanding your daily
        spending habits. Centsible represents our belief that everyone deserves
        access to clear, actionable insights about their money without needing a
        finance degree to understand them. Built with modern web technologies
        and designed with real users in mind, we've created a platform that
        grows with you, whether you're a college student tracking your first
        budget or a seasoned professional managing multiple expense categories.
        Every feature we've added stems from real user needs and our commitment
        to making financial awareness accessible, secure, and genuinely helpful.

      <h1>Mission & Vision</h1>
      <p>
        Our mission is to democratize financial awareness by providing intuitive
        tools that transform how people understand and manage their money. We
        believe that financial empowerment shouldn't be a privilege reserved for
        those with extensive financial knowledge or expensive advisory services.
        Through Centsible, we're breaking down the barriers between people and
        their financial data, making it possible for anyone to gain meaningful
        insights into their spending patterns, identify areas for improvement,
        and make informed decisions about their financial future. Every dollar
        tracked, every chart generated, and every insight delivered serves our
        core purpose: helping individuals take control of their financial
        journey with confidence and clarity. <br />Our vision extends beyond
        simple expense tracking – we're building toward a future where financial
        literacy is universal and financial stress becomes a thing of the past.
        We envision Centsible as the trusted companion that grows with users
        throughout their financial journey, from their first paycheck to major
        life milestones. By combining cutting-edge technology with
        human-centered design, we're creating an ecosystem where financial
        awareness leads to better decision-making, reduced anxiety about money,
        and ultimately, more fulfilling lives. We see a world where
        understanding your finances is as simple and routine as checking the
        weather, and where every person has the tools they need to build a
        secure and prosperous future.

      <h1>The Technology Behind Centsible</h1>
      <p>Centsible is built on a foundation of modern web technologies that 
        prioritize both performance and security. At its core, we leverage 
        Firebase's robust infrastructure to ensure your financial data is stored 
        securely in the cloud with enterprise-grade encryption and real-time 
        synchronization across all your devices. Our frontend utilizes vanilla 
        JavaScript combined with Chart.js for dynamic data visualization, creating 
        responsive and interactive charts that transform raw spending data into 
        meaningful insights. The application is designed with a mobile-first approach, 
        ensuring seamless functionality whether you're logging expenses on your 
        smartphone during lunch or reviewing monthly reports on your desktop at 
        home.<br>Behind the scenes, our architecture is built for scalability and 
        reliability. We implement real-time data processing that instantly updates 
        your spending analytics as you add new expenses, while our secure authentication 
        system ensures that only you can access your financial information. The platform 
        uses modern web standards and progressive enhancement techniques, meaning it 
        works reliably across different browsers and devices without requiring app 
        store downloads or complex installations. Every line of code is written with 
        privacy by design principles, ensuring that your sensitive financial data never 
        leaves Google's secure servers, and all communications between your device 
        and our systems are encrypted end-to-end. This technical foundation allows 
        us to focus on what matters most – delivering a fast, reliable, and secure 
        experience that makes financial tracking effortless.</p>
